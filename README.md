## Hi, I'm Nina. 👩🏻‍💻

I'm Nina, a 33 year old self-taught frontend developer with a passion for visual identity.

Although I have diploma in physical therapy, in October 2019 I decided it was time for a change. I started to study to become frontend developer (HTML, CSS and JS) before going into work. I quickly started to love it and I decided to take the risk with going in full time. My studies were my prime task until July 2020, when I landed my
first job. Started as intern and now I work as Junior Developer. 

I'm passionate towards learning and minimalistic design. Love sharing my knowledge and my insights of learning with others.. I'm hard working, super curious, passionate, committed and a fast learner!
