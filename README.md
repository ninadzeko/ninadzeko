## 👋🏻 GM 👩🏻‍💻

I'm Nina, a 34 years old self-taught frontend developer with a passion for visual identity.

Although I have diploma in physical therapy, in October 2019 I decided it was time for a change. I started to study to become frontend developer (HTML, CSS and JS) before going into work. I quickly started to love it and I decided to take the risk with going in full time. My studies were my prime task until July 2020, when I landed my first job. Started as intern and now I work as Junior Software Engenineer. 

I'm passionate towards learning new tehnologies and minimalistic design. Love sharing my knowledge and my insights of learning with others.. I'm hard working, super curious, passionate, committed and a fast learner!
